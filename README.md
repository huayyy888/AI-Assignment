## Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting **fake job postings** from a dataset of job listings. The workflow includes:

1. Text preprocessing (cleaning and generating `cleaned_text`).  
2. Feature extraction using **TF-IDF**.  
3. Training **machine learning models**: Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and SVM.  
4. Handling **imbalanced data** using methods like undersampling, oversampling, and hybrid approaches.  
5. Deploying the predictive model as a **Streamlit app** for easy interaction.

## Models Used
- **Random Forest Classifier**  
- **Naive Bayes Classifier**  
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  

> Each model is evaluated with different strategies to handle imbalanced data for better detection of fraudulent postings.

## Deployment
The project is deployed on **Streamlit**:
